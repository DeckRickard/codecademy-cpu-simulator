# INSTRUCTION FORMATTING:
# Instructions for the CPU simulator must consist of an opcode (denoting the type of operation to be performed) and between 1 and 3 operands.
# Operands can be directly inserted numbers or they can retrieve a value from a cache or memory address. 
# () brackets denote a cache address
# {} curly brackets denote a memory address
# All mathematical operations are automatically saved to a particular address (destination_register), this must be specified in the instruction.
#
# Valid opcodes are:
# "add": Adds two values together - add operand_1 operand_2 destination_register
# "sub": Subtracts two values - sub operand_1 operand_2 destination_register
# "mult": Multiples two numbers together - mult operand_1 operand_2 destination_register
# "div": Divides two numbers - div operand_1 operand_2 destination_register
# "sw": Saves a value to a cache or memory address - sw value destination_register
# "lw": Returns the value found at a memory or cache address - lw register
# Any lines beginning with a '#' are comments, and are ignored by the interpreter.
# Enter your instructions, with a line return between each, below:
sw 4 5 (8)
sw 5 (1)
sw 20 (2)
sw 4 (4)
add (1) (2) (3)
mult (3) (4) (5)
